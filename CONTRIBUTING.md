# Contributing

**Contributions are *always* welcome**.

If you're just looking to help out, there's a list of tasks that are left to be done in the issue tracker. That said, should you wish to add a new feature, just fork, test, develop and go ahead! There's a few ground rules, nothing is set in stone but this stuff will speed up the merging process.

* Write tests. Testing is good.
* Stick to the community driven Ruby style guide. (Pad braces, single quotes for strings etc...)
* Document your code. Use RDoc. Self-documenting code is great, but just a line or two about what you're trying to achieve would be great.

*That's it!* The rest is up to you!
